summary: Vault is a tool for securely accessing secrets.
description: |
  A modern system requires access to a multitude of secrets: database
  credentials, API keys for external services, credentials for service-oriented
  architecture communication, etc. Understanding who is accessing what secrets
  is already very difficult and platform-specific. Adding on key rolling,
  secure storage, and detailed audit logs is almost impossible without a custom
  solution. This is where Vault steps in.
